- **Test-first programming steps**
	- **Spec**: write a specification for the function.
	- **Test**: Write tests that exercise the specification.
	- **Implement**: Write the implementation.
- **Choosing test cases by partitioning**
	- Divede the input space into subdomains, each consisting of a set of inputs.
		- Every input lies in exactly one subdomain, we choose one test case from each subdomain, and that's  a test suite.
	- **Include boundaries in the partition**
