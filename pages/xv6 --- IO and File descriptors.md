- ## File Descriptor
	- A _file descriptor_ is a small integer representing a kernel-managed object that a process may read from or write to.
		- A process may obtain a file descriptor --
			- by opening a file, directory, or device.
			- by creating a pipe.
			- by duplicating an existing descriptor.
		- The file descriptor interface abstracts away the diffrerence between files, pipes, and devices, making them all look like streams of bytes.
	- The xv6 kernel uses the file descriptor as an index into a per-processor table,  so that every process has a private space of file descriptors starting at zero.
		- By convention, a process
			- read form file descriptor 0 (standard input)
			- wirte output to file descriptor 1 (standard output)
			- writes error messages to file descriptor 2 (standard error)
- ## IO
	- ### `int read(fd, buf, n)`
	- ### `int write(fd, buf, n)`
- ## Pipes
	- A pipe is a small kernel buffer exposed to processes as a pair of file descriptors.
