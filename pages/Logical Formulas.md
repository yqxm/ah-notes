- **Implies**
	- #+BEGIN_NOTE
	  An implication is true exactly when if-part is false or the then-part is true
	  #+END_NOTE
	- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
	  Mathematical implications ignore causal connections between hypotheses and conclusions.

- ## Equivalence and validity
	- **Use truth table to simplify logic expressions.**
		- Expressions whose truth values always match are called **_equivalent_**.
	- **Equivalent**
		- An implication and its contrapositive are equivalent.
		- An implication and its converse together are equivalent to an iff statement.
	- **Validity and Satisfiability**
		- a **_valid_** formula is one which is _always_ true, no matter what truth values its variables may have.
		- a **_satisfiable_**  formula is one which can _sometimes_ be true-- that is, there is some assignment of truth values to its variables that makes it true.
		- The relationship between validity and satisfiability: a statement $P$ is satisfiable iff its negation $NOT(P)$ is not valid.
- ## The algebra of Propositions
	- Every popositional formula is equivalent to a "sum-of-products" or **_disjunctive normal form_**.
