## Variable and Basic Types

### Primitive Built-in Types

| Type        | Meaning                           | Minimun Size          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| bool        | boolean                           | NA                    |
| char        | character                         | 8 bits                |
| wchar_t     | wide character                    | 16 bits               |
| char16_t    | Unicode character                 | 16 bits               |
| char32_t    | Unicode character                 | 32 bits               |
| short       | short integer                     | 16 bits               |
| int         | integer                           | 16 bits               |
| long        | long integer                      | 32 bits               |
| long long   | long integer                      | 64 bits               |
| float       | simple-precision floating-point   | 6 significant digits  |
| double      | double-precision floating-point   | 10 significant digits |
| long double | extended-precision floating-point | 10 significant digits |

`char` is guaranteed to be big enough to hold numeric values corresponding to the characters in the machine's basic character set.

`wchar_t`,`char16_t`,`char32_t` are used for extended character sets.

Typically,`float` is 32 bits. `double` is 64 bits. `long double` is 96 or 128 bits.

#### Signed and Unsigned

Except for `bool` and the extended character types, the integral types may be signed or unsigned.

`char` is special. it has three distenct types: `char`,`signed char`,`unsigned char`. But it only have two presentations: signed and unsigned. `char` use one of these representations.Which of these to use depends on compiler.
