- The phrase "if and only if" is abbreviated "iff".
- **Method \# 1: Prove Each Statement Implies the Other**
	- The statement $P \iff Q$ is equivalent to the two statements $P \rightarrow Q$ and $Q \rightarrow P$.‚Äù
	- **Steps:**
		- Write, "We prove $P \rightarrow Q$ and vice-versa."
		- Write, "First, we show $P \rightarrow Q$." then [prove it]([[Proving an Implication]])
		- write, "Now, we show $Q \rightarrow P$, the [prove it]([[Proving an Implication]])
- **Method \#2: Construct a Chain of Iffs**
	- **Steps:**
		- Write, "We construct a chain of iff implications."
		- Prove $P$ is equivalent to a second statement which is equivalent to a third statement and so forth until you reach $Q$.
	- **Example:**
		- **Theorem**. The standard deviation of a sequence of values $x_1,\dots,x_n$ is zero iff all the values are eaual to the mean.
