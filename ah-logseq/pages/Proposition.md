- **Definition**: A statement (communication) that is either true or false
- **e.g:**
	- For every none negative integer n, the value of $n^2+n+41$ is a prime number.
		- From 1 to 39, this proposition is true.
		- If `n` is 40 or 41, the proposition is false.
- **Term for a proposition that has been proved**:
	- Important true propositions are called _theorems_.
	- A _lemma_ is a preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions.
	- A _corollary_ is a proposition that follows in just a few logical steps from a theorem.
