- **C++ Fundamental types**
	- `int`, `char``, float``, double`, `bool`
	- `std::string`
- C++ is a _**statically typed**_ language
	- **statically typed**: Everything with a name is given a type before runtime.
		- It helps us to prevent errors before code runs.
- **overloading**: Define two functions with the same name but different types.
- `auto`
	- You can use type deductions with `auto`.
	- It doesn't mean that the variable doesn't have a type.
	- #+BEGIN_TIP
	  Don't overuse `auto`. Use it for reduce long type names.
