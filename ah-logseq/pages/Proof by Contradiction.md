- If a proposition were false, then some false fact would be true. Since a false fact by definition can't be true, the proposition must be true.
- **Steps:**
	- Write, "We use proof by contradiction."
	- Write, "Suppose $P$ is false."
	- Deduce something known to be false (a logical contradiction)
	- Write, "This is a contradiction. Therefore, $P$ must be true."
- **Example:**
	- **Theroem.** $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
