- **Don't repeat yourself(DRY)**
- **Comments where needed**
	- One kind of crucial comment is a specification, which appears above a method or above a class and documents the behavior of the method or class.
	- Another crucial comment is one that specifies the provenance or source of a piece of code that was copied or adapted from elsewhere.
- **Fail fast**: It means that code should reveal its bugs as early as possible.
- **Avoid magic numbers**
- **One purpose for each variable**
- **Don't use global variables**
- **Methods should return results, not print them**
	- In general, only the highest-level parts of a program should interact with the human user or the console. Lower-level parts should take their input as parameters and return their output as results.
		- The sole exception here is debugging output, which can of course be printed to the console. But that kind of output shouldn’t be a part of your design, only a part of how you debug your design.
- **Avoid special-case code**
	- **Actively resist the temptation to handle special cases separately.**
		- If you find yourself writing an `if` statement for a special case, stop what you’re doing, and instead think harder about the general-case code, either to confirm that it can actually already handle the special case you’re worrying about (which is often true!), or put in a little more effort to make it handle the special case.
