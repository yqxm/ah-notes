- ## Why do we need a special query language?
	- The relational algebra is useful because it's less powerful than C or Java. By limiting what we can say or do in out query language, we get two huge rewards.
		- Ease of programming
		- Make the compiler can produce highly optimized code.
- ## Relational algebra
	- ### _Atomic operands_
		- _Variables_ that stand for relations.
		- _Constants_, which are finite relations.
	- ### _Overview of operations_
		- _The usual set operations_
			- union
			- intersection
			- difference
		- _Remove parts of a relation_
			- Selection: It eliminates some rows(tuples)
			- Projection: It eliminates some columns.
		- _Combine the tuples of two relations_
			- Cartesion product: Pairs the tuples of two relations in
		- _Renaming: change the relation schema_
			- It does not affect the tuples of a relation, but changes the relation schema, i.e., the names of the attributes and/or the names of the relation itself.
