# Intro

Database: data managed by DBMS.

The DBMS is expected to:

- Allow users to create databases and specify schemes.(use *DDL*)
- Give users the ability to query the data and modify the data.(use *DML*)
- Support the storage of large amount of data over a long period of time, allowing efficient access to the data for queries and database modifications.
- Enable *durability*.The recovery of the database in the face of failures, errors of many kind or intentional misuse.
- Controll access to data from many users at once, without allowing unexpected interactions among users (called *isolation*) and without actions on the data to be performed partially not completely (called *atomicity*).
