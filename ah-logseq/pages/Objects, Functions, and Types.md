  Every type in C is either an _object_ type or a _function_ type
  #+END_NOTE
- **Object:** An *Object* is storage in which you can represent values.
- **Variable:** *Variables* have a declared *type* that tells you the kind of object its value represents.
- **Function:** *Functions* are not objects but do have types. A function type is characterized by both its return type as well as the number and types of its parameters.
- **Pointer:** *Pointers* can be thought of as an *address*--a location in memory where an object or function is stored.
	- A pointer type is derived from a function or object type called the _referenced type_.
- **Scope:**
	- **Four types of scope:**
		- **File:** The declaration is outside any block or parameter list, then it has _file scope_, meaning the scope is the entire text file in which it appears as well as any files included after that point.
		- **Block:** The declaration is inside a block or within the list of parameters.
		- **Function Prototype:** The declaration appears within the list of parameter declarations in a function prototype(not part of function definition), which terminates at the end of the function declarator.
		- **Function:**  The area between the opening \{ of a function definition and its closing \}
	- Scope can be *nested*, _inner_ scope can access _outer_ scope, but not vice-versa.
- **Storage duration**
	- Four storage duration are available: automatic, static, thread, and allocated.
		- **automatic**: Objects declared within a block or as a function parameter.
		- **static:** Objects declared in file scope.
			- The lifetime of these objects is the entire execution of the program.
			- The stored value is initialized prior to program startup.
			- Use `static` specifier to make a variable in block scope have static storage duration.
- **Object types**
	- **Boolean:** `<stdbool.h>`, use `bool`.
	- **Character:**
		- Different compilers will make `char` to be same with `unsigned char` or `signed char`.  But `char` is a separate type from the other two and is incompatible with both.
		- `wchar_t` have a larger character set.
	- **Numerical:**
		- Integer
		- **enum:** `enum` allows you to define a type that assigns names to integer values in cases with an enumerable set of constant values.
		- Floating-Point
		- **void:** The keyword `void` (by itself) means "cannot hold any value". `void *` means that the pointer can reference _any_ object.
- **Function Types**
