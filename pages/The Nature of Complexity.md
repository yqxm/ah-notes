- **Complexity**
	- **Definition:** Anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.
		- **E.g**
			- Hard to understand the code.
			- Hard to make a small improvement
			- Do not know where to modify to make improvement.
			- Hard to debug.
	- $$C = \sum_p c_p t_p$$
		- The overall complexity of a system ($C$) is determined by the complexity of each part $p(c_p)$ weighted by the fraction of time developers spend working on that part($t_p$)
		- Isolating complexity in a place where it will never be seen is almost as good as elimination the complexity entirely.
- **Symptoms of complexity**
	- **Change amplification:**
		- A seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many diffrent places.
	- **Cognitive load:**
		- It refers to how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task.
			- A higher cognitive load means that developers have to spend more time learning the required information. And there is greater risk of bugs because they have missed something important.
		- It arise in many ways, such as _**API with many methods**_, _**global variables**_, _**inconsistencies**_, and _**dependencies bwtween modules**_.
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Sometimes an approach that requires more lines of code is actually simpler, because it reduces cognitive load.

	- **Unknown unknowns:**
		- It is not obvious which piece of code must be modified to complete task, or what information a developer must have to carry out the task successfully.
			- Theres is something you need to know, but there is no way for you to find out what it is, or even, whether there is an issue.
- **Causes of complexity**
	- **_dependencies_**
		- A dependency exists when a given piece of code cannot be understood and modified in isolation; the code relates in someway to other code, and the other code must be considered and/or modified if the given code is changed.
	- **_obscurity_**
		- Obscurity occurs when important information is not obvious.
			- Obscurity is often associate with dependencies, where it is not obvious that a dependency exists.
			- Inconsistency is also a major contributor to obscurity: if the same variable name is used for two diffrent purposes.
- ## **Complexity is incremental**
