- ## Iterators
	- Iterators: A way to access all containers. It has an "ordering" over elements.
		- Iterators are objects that point to elements inside containers.
		- Each STL container has its own iterator, but all of these iterators exhibit a similar behavior.
		- Gerally, STL iteraltors support some operations in common. [[E.g. C++ STL Iterators operations]]
	- ### Types of Iterators
		- Input and Output iterators: Perform sequential single-pass input or output operation.
		- Forward iterators: Limited to one direction in which to iterate through a range(forward).
		- Bidirectional iterators: Can iterate forwards and backwards.
		- Random-access iterator:  Can access ranges non-sequentially.
- ## Pointers
	- When variables are created, they're given an address in memory.
	- Pointers are objects that store an address and type of variable.
		- Iterators are a form of pointers.
