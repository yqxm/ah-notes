- **Attributes**: Columns of a relation.Describes the meaning of entries in the column below.
- **Schema**: The name of a relation.
- **Tuples**: The rows of a relation, other than the header row containing the attribute names.
- **Domains**: Each attribute of a relation is a *domain*, which is a particular elementary type.
