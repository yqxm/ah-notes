			- It's worth taking a little extra time to find a simple design for each new class, rather than implementing the first idea that comes to mind.
			- Writing good documentation
		- **Reactive investment**
			- As system grows, old design will make mistakes, don't just ignore it or patch around it; take a little extra time to fix it.
