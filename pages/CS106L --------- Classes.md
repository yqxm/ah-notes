- ## Class
	- `class`: A programmer defined custom type. An abstraction of object or data type.
		- Classes provide their user with a public interface and separate this form a private implementation.
	- ### Issues with structs:
		- Public access to all internal state data by default.
		- Users of struct need to explicitly initialize each data member.
	- [[eg ------ C++ class student]]
		- #### Public section
			- Users of Object can directly access any thing in public section.
			- Define interface for interacting with private member variables.
		- #### Private section
			- Usually contains all member variables.
			- Users can't access or modify anything in the private section
- ## namespaces
	- ### `namespace`:
		- Put code into logical groups, to void name clashes.
		- Each class has its own name space
		- Syntax for calling/using something in a namespace. `namespace_name::name`
	- ### Function definition with namespaces
		- `namespace_name::name` in a function prototype means "this is the implementation for an interface function in namespace_name"
		- Inside the `{...}` the priate member variables for `namespace_name` will be in scope.
